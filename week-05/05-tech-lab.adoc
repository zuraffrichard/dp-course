= Lab 05 Work management with Teams and Github



==  Overview

This will be another relatively light lab, as we continue to get caught up on the technical labs from Context 1. 

Let's look at how to manage the flow of work in Github. 

For this exercise, we will split into teams 

=== Github as Kanban

Github can turn the issue - pull request flow into a basic Kanban board. See: 

https://github.com/dm-academy/dp-course/projects/1

https://github.com/dm-academy/node-svc/projects/1

ASSIGNMENT: For your team, one of you create a test repository and give push (commit) permissions to your other teammates. Take turns submitting issues, assigning them to each other, and approving and commiting changes. Set up the project kanban (using the Projects tab at the top). Take screenshots of the card as it moves through the Kanban board and submit to Canvas.

Experiment with different access levels (write vs maintain). See your repository settings to invite & set permissions. 

=== Basic Cost of Delay

As a team, review the DPBoK 6.2.2.2, and also:

Open the Cost of Delay Prioritization Calculator and save locally (one per team):

As a team, develop a product roadmap based on Cost of Delay. Here are the assumptions: 

* You have an 5-person team, and at 80% time you have 20 person-days per week. You operate in 2-week sprints (40 days). Assume the team is paid, in total, $10,000/week.
* Over the next 4 months, you would like to develop 20 new features. 
** 20% of the new features will take 2 person days
** 20% will take 5 person days
** 20% will take 10 person days
** 20% will take 20 person days
** 20% will take 35 person days

** 25% are worth $10/day
** 25% are worth $50/day
** 25% are worth $200/day
** 25% are worth $1000/day

(Duration and priority are randomly associated - use whatever mix you like, but do mix them up - for example, your $1000/day value features should be a mix of the various durations, chosen from 2, 5, 10, 20, 35.)

Also, features cannot cross Scrum iteration boundaries. They must be started and finished within the sprint. 

The feature starts making money as soon as the iteration is done. So, if you create a $50/day feature in iteration 1, as soon as iteration 2 starts your company is making $50/day, 7 days a week. You need to add this up and increase the revenue number whenever new features come on line. 

Developing your own format for the project plan (a spreadsheet is fine), answer the following questions: 

* How many sprints are required if the priority order must be strictly maintained, even if it means serious downtime for the team? (what if you have 30 days of work but the next priority is 15 days?) How many "wasted" days is this?

* How many sprints are required if we relax the requirement to do things in priority order, so that we are more fully utilized and get done sooner? (This means you might move some work around so everything fits better.)

* What are the economic consequences of optimizing for getting done sooner (and so paying the team less), if that means we move less valuable work forward? Do we really save money by deferring more valuable work? Or is there a short term gain, long term cost?

Your spreadsheet should show the necessary calculations. You may write them up in Word or Powerpoint. 

Since you all will make different assumptions, there is no right or wrong answer. Be prepared to present and discuss your findings in class. 


_Fall 2020 instructor's notes: emphasize cumulative value per day, and calibrate final #s so that costs/benefits are more aligned_
