= Frequently asked questions

== Are my Google ID and Google Cloud Project the same? 

NO. 

== What is my Google ID? 
Your Google ID is your gmail ID, before the @ sign. It is also your username on the Google Cloud Shell.

== What is my Google Cloud Project? 

The Google Cloud Project is a unique string of words and numbers that you can find in the Google console top left. Typically the menu item defaults to "My First Project":

image:images/GoogleProj.png[]

Under that menu you'll see the ID(s): 

image:images/GoogleProj2.png[]

(Your ID will NOT start with "proven-sum-", it will be some other random string of words and numbers. You can copy it from the menu here. You'll use it in many places throughout your work with Google.)


== I pasted in a command and it doesn't work

Often, this is the result of not correctly substituting a value. 

A tutorial may have a step like: 

_Enter the following command_

`$ mkdir <my account>`

If you paste that in literally, you will get something like this: 

`-bash: syntax error near unexpected token `newline'`

This is because 

. You pasted in the `$`, which is there to just show you that you are operating at a command line
. You pasted in, literally, `<my account>`, rather than replacing the `<my account>` with YOUR ACTUAL EMAIL ACCOUNT. In this case, you would NOT include the @stthomas.edu or @gmail.com; however, this may vary. 

This applies in many cases, such as 

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone <my repo path>    # substitute the ACTUAL GITHUB PATH
$ curl <Kubernetes node IP:port>   # substitute the ACTUAL NODE IP ADDRESS, followed by ":", followed by the port.
----
and so forth. 

Some tutorials may not use <>; there is no standard. 

== Nothing works like I expect (have you lost track of where you are?). 

One big cause of frustration is losing track of where you are. Stop for a minute: are you in the Google Cloud Shell? Or an actual virtual machine you have created? The Google Cloud Shell has, for example, git and node installed. A fresh, lightweight VM probably will not. 

== Offending ECDSA key
If you get an `offending ECDSA key` error, use the suggested removal command.

== Permission denied (publickey)

If you have not set up an SSH public/private key, you will get this error. Consult the appropriate lab materials; this is part of the instruction. 

IF ssh *has worked before* on the Google Cloud Shell and you get the error `Permission denied (publickey).`, this probably means that your ssh-agent no longer has the node-user private key added. This easily happens if the Google Cloud Shell goes to sleep and wipes out your session. Check via issuing `ssh-add -l`.

If you get a message to the effect that your agent is not running, type `eval `ssh-agent`` and then `ssh-add ~/.ssh/node-user`.

You should see something like `Identity added: /home/user/.ssh/node-user (node-user)`.

You should now be able to ssh, scp, or rsh. 

== Terraform error refreshing state

If you get 

[source,bash]
----
Error refreshing state: state snapshot was created by Terraform v0.12.8, which is newer than current v0.12.2; upgrade to Terraform v0.12.8 or greater to work with this state
----

execute 

[source,bash]
----
rm -rf terraform.tfstate
terraform init
----

== Nano garbled

If text is overlapping in nano, hit ctrl-L to redraw. 

I had partial success including 

export TERM=screen

in my .bashrc file, but that only seems to work if I only use page up/down. Scrolling with the arrow key is still a problem. 

Issue: https://github.com/vercel/hyper/issues/3391

== Insufficient Permission in Google Cloud Shell

If you receive an `Insufficient Permission` error in the Google Cloud Shell, you may need to reauthenticate. Type `gcloud auth login` and follow the resulting steps.

== Project property set to the empty string

If you get:
[source,bash]
----
 The project property is set to the empty string, which is invalid. To set your project, run: $ gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID or to unset it, run: $ gcloud config unset 

----

Follow the suggested command. Your project name is visible in the Google Cloud Shell, top right usually under "My First Project." When you find it, issue the command

[source,bash]
----
gcloud config set project <MY PROJECT NAME>
Updated property [core/project].prkjnghn@cloudshell:~ 
----

Obviously, you change <MY PROJECT NAME> to your actual project (and leave out the <>).

== API not enabled

If you receive

[source,bash]
----
API [compute.googleapis.com] not enabled on project [389601984173].Would you like to enable and retry (this will take a few minutes)?(y/N)?  
----

Hit `y`, you should get:

`Enabling service [compute.googleapis.com] on project [389601984173]...`

== Address already in use

When starting up the nodejs server with `nodejs server.js &` you may encounter a `address already in use` error. Read carefully, as this output may be further down in the error output. This indicates that there is already a node server running. If you would like to start over, run `ps -ef` to list processes and then kill the correct process by id: `kill {process id}`

== Port already allocated (not to be confused with address already in use)
If on a `docker run` you get 

[source,bash]
----
betz4871:node-svc$ docker run -d -p 8081:30100 dmacademy/node-svc
8d25efd0b098984d5bf16038f609a5fc54861beb36345ad67ea011feb991c397
docker: Error response from daemon: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint wizardly_shamir (c730f2ed00186404cef02d6e9d97d2f14f4d4328e5102393f3cff1f2d9ffaca8): Bind for 0.0.0.0:8081 failed: port is already allocated.
----

This means you already have a docker container running and attached to that port. 

run `docker ps` and `docker kill` the image name that is already attached to that port.

[source,bash]
----
betz4871:node-svc$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES

== Switching Github remote from http (cleartext password) to ssh
See https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git/changing-a-remotes-url[this link.]

== npm ERR! 
if when trying to execute `docker build ` you get 

[source,bash]
----

=== Terraform version issues
NOTE: As of early fall 2020, the Google Cloud Shell versions of Terraform and the Google Cloud Provisioner were out of date. This seems to have been fixed, but retaining this here. 

You may need to install a local version of Terraform and always call it explicitly. 

First, run:

[source,bash]
----
$ terraform -v # Google's version

----

If you get a Terraform version under 13, such as: 

[source,bash]
----
Terraform v0.12.24
+ provider.google v2.5.1
Your version of Terraform is out of date! The latest version
is 0.13.4. You can update by downloading from https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html
betz4871:node-svc$ ~/bin/terraform -v
---- 

then you need to upgrade. (If you get a current version, then go to the next section, otherwise continue here.)

Inspect and run: 

[source,bash]
----
$ update-terraform.sh
----

This installs Terraform 13 in your local ~/bin directory. 

See the difference: 

[source,bash]
----

$ ~/terraform -v # your version
  Terraform v0.13.4
+ provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/google v3.37.0
----

You need to ALWAYS call Terraform thus: 

[source,bash]
----
$ ~/bin/terraform apply
----

Terraform will CRASH HARD if you do not do this.

=== Github Actions Failing with an "Unexpected token ۶ in JSON at position 0"
NOTE: If you are getting the error "Unexpected token ۶ in JSON at position 0" then you will need to look
at your GKE_SA_KEY and make sure that this is correct. You should go ahead and copy the key again and redo 
your earlier entry.  Again, you are looking for a key that has many lines and not just a one line or 20 
character key.

How do you get to the GKE_SA_KEY again?  First go into Settings in the directory that you are currently in 
here in Github, then select Secrets on the left hand menu.
